Introduction

Computation: solving a complex problem by repeated, systematic execution of a series of simple and straightforward operations

Algorithm is characterized by:
1.) a precise statement of the starting conditions, which are inputs to the algorithm
2.) a specification of the final state of the algorithm, which is used to decide when the algorithm will terminate
3.) a detailed description of the individual steps, each of which is simple and straight-forward operation that will help move the algorithm toward its final state
