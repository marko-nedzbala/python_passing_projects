Exploring Python

The purpose of an object is to contain information and to give the programmer the ability to do things with that information (properties)

Introducing PyGame

Pygame is built on the game creation library called Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL)
Not all modules from Pygame are guaranteed to be present on every platform and if they are not installed then Pygame will set the module to None

$ pip install pygame

pygame.init()
initializes each of the submodules in the pygame package, loads drivers and query hardware so that Pygame is ready to use all the devices on your computer
pygame.sound.init() #initialize the module you intend to use individually

Posting an event
my_event = pygame.event.Event(KEYDOWN, key=K_SPACE, mod=0, unicode=u' ')
pgame.event.post(my_event)

# also acceptable to use a dictionary
my_event = pygame.event.Event(KEYDOWN, {"key":K_SPACE, "mod":0, "unicode":u' '})

Full-screen displays
pygame.display.list_modes()
